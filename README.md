IoT &amp; Embedded


You have been challenged by Braintronix to develop an AI for mobile robotics using Kinect and speech recognition.

Use your C++ or Python skills to program a robot that will recognize shapes and colors and will obey his master’s voice. We will provide the ROS architecture.

The expected outcome is a robot capable of identifying different objects according to the voice commands received from his master.
